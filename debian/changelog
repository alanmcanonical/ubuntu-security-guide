ubuntu-security-guides (20.04.10) focal; urgency=medium

  * New version based on ComplianceAsCode project. Version bumped to 20.04.10
    since this is a major release.
  * Replaces helper script usg-cis by usg, which includes additional features.
    - Generation of a bash script bundle containing all the fixes
    - Possibility of fixing the uncompliant rules after the audit process.
  * Includes benchmarks and fix scripts for CIS (all profiles on version 1.0.0
    for Focal) and for DISA-STIG.
  * package name changed to reflect the addition of DISA-STIG benchmark (and
    possible others in the future)
  * Documentation broken in man pages for easier access
  * Upgrades preserve old benchmarks versions
  * Addition of tailoring files which allow users to easily customize which
    rules will be audited/enforced
  * Package isn't considered an upgrade to old ubuntu security guides packages
    anymore. Albeit it conflicts with them.
